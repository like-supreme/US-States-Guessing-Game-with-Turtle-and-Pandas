# US-States-Guessing-Game-with-Turtle-and-Pandas
A fun Python game that challenges users to guess U.S. states. Built using the turtle module and pandas, this interactive map displays state names on a blank U.S. map when the user types a correct guess. A great project for practicing Python, data handling with CSV, and graphical interfaces.
